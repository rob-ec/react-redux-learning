Description
---
My very first react experiment.  

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [PortuguÃªs do Brasil](README.pt-BR.md)*

Available Scripts
---
In the project directory, you can run:  

> `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.  
So open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.  

You also could use:

> `npm run build`

It builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
