My very first react experiment.

Available Scripts
---
In the project directory, you can run:

> `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.<br />
So open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You also could use:

> `npm run build`

Ii builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
